# Agile Actors Academy

Welcome to Node.js Workshop!

## Introduction

In this workshop we will introduce the core concepts of Node.js and how you can use them to develop a modern node application. 

We will start from the very beginning, from "I don't even know how use it..and why would Iâ€œ to actually understanding how Node.js and javascript works and use its power.

You will learn all the logic and practice behind Node.js in different modules, and as we advance through the workshop we will be increasing the difficulty.. :sunglasses:

## What We'll build

We are going to build a chat app using Node.js and a real time board for chat analytics. We have split the steps in several branches with each branch has its own tasks which you have to complete in order to proceed to the next branch.
